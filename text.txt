i will provide you with a list of questions, and i would like you to number, and answer them. give the answer choices aswell (a,b,c,d) so for example if the answer is b and b's answer is "red", i want you to say B: red

I would like you to provide a full answer sheet at the end, for exmaple:
{
question 1: answer choice, answer
question 2: answer choice, answer
and so on
]

for answers with multiple choices, answer it in this format:
{
question1: correctchoice1,correctchoice2, correctchoice3

example of a real multiple answer question:
question1: a,b,d,e - 
]


I will now give you the questions.
